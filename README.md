# AVPoetica
AV-Poetica is a mini-module in a larger Vietnamese poetry generation system that utilizes an LLM Agent to perform advanced customization, correction, and stylistic post-processing on raw poetic outputs. The module refines machine-generated verses to better align with traditional Vietnamese poetic aesthetics (eg., lục bát,..) and cultural tone.
